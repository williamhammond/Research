% Description:  This code applies the k-nn algorithm on a set of synthetic 
%               TMP signals based off a single patient. The patient's 
%               geometry was used to exhaustively simulate the TMP 
%               signals treating every possible node in the heart as the 
%               source of the signal. 


% Path to directory holding all of the TMP signals 
dataPath = '../data/processed/Simulation/1898/Output/forward/';
% The number of nodes
dim = 1898;
% The number of timesteps we used 
nTime = 10153;

i = 1;
fileName = sprintf('output%d.bin', i);
resultPath = strcat(dataPath,fileName);

fid = fopen(resultPath,'r');
output1 = fread(fid, [nTime,dim], 'double');
fclose(fid);

i = 2;
fileName = sprintf('output%d.bin', i);
resultPath = strcat(dataPath,fileName);

fid = fopen(resultPath,'r');
output2 = fread(fid, [nTime,dim], 'double');
fclose(fid);
